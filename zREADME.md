These are all the exercises I am tackling with in my python programming learning journey. 
all the codes and logics have been implemented by myself.
I am showcasing what I learn. 
time to time I add more exercises to this repository.
for a better undestanding of what these exercises are about, I will write a brief description of each problem(file):
------------------------------
1- PRIME FACTORIZATION : write a program to calculate all prime factors of a given number.
-------------------------------
2- CLASSES & OBEJCTS: writing some simple class to learn basic usage of a class and to see what is an object(also implementing abstracted method in our file).
-------------------------------
3- UNIVERSITY AGGREGATION : using aggregation approach to make a simple list of the names of students in a university.
-------------------------------
4- LIBRARY COMPOSITION: using composition approach to make a simple list of the books in a library.
-------------------------------
